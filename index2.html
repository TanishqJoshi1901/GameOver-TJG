    <h2>Lets Know About Gaming..!</h2>
    <h3><b><u>Gaming refers to playing electronic games, whether through consoles, computers, mobile phones or another medium altogether. Gaming is a nuanced term that suggests regular gameplay, possibly as a hobby. Although traditionally a solitary form of relaxation, online multiplayer video games have made gaming a popular group activity as well.

        A person who is into gaming is often called a gamer or hardcore gamer.</b></u></h3>
